         <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
         <p>My name is Angela Mbithe. I am an entreprenuer as well as aspiring web developer. For my tertiary level education I attended Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, where I studied BBIT. After that I worked in Daystar University as an IT support officer, for a period of around one year.</p>
         <p>My decision to join Moringa School was influenced by my interest to change the career path I was in. I wanted to become a software developer but I didn't have the skills. It was when i set out to look for a school to enhance my skills that I found Moringa School from my google searches. I then conducted a little research and when i was satisfied with the results, I decided to apply for the software development course.</p>
